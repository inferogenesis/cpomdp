    it runs on every filter step; this runs once, so it doesn't have to.) Both

class LQRController:
    """Steady-state LQR action selection — the action-side dual of the filter.

    Where the Kalman filter front-loads perception (solve the estimation Riccati
    once for the steady-state gain ``K∞``, then ``mean += K∞·prediction_error``),
    this front-loads action: solve the dual *control* Riccati once for ``L∞``,
    then ``action = -L∞·(mean − goal)``. Both gains are data-independent, both are
    computed at construction, and together they are LQG (see RESEARCH.md).

    The load-bearing claim (ADR-003) is that LQR *is* active inference here, not a
    substitute for it. For a fixed linear-Gaussian sensor the covariance recursion
    is control-independent, so Expected Free Energy's epistemic term is identical
    for every action and drops out of the argmin; EFE-minimising selection reduces
    to its pragmatic term, and the pragmatic term under a Gaussian preference is a
    quadratic cost whose optimum is exactly LQR. The epistemic term only re-enters
    once sensing depends on the state or action — out of scope for v0.1.

    The two cost matrices are named by role, not by LQR's traditional ``Q``/``R``:
    those letters already mean the noise covariances on the model
    (``dynamics_noise``/``sensor_noise``), and reusing them here is the exact
    collision ADR-003 warns about.

    Args:
        model: The linear-Gaussian model to act in. Must carry a ``control``
            matrix — there is nothing to act with otherwise.
        state_cost: How much deviation from the goal costs, an ``(n, n)`` matrix.
            Heavier ``state_cost`` buys a more aggressive controller. (LQR's
            ``Q``; here the precision of the preference over states.)
        control_cost: How much action costs, a ``(p, p)`` matrix. Heavier
            ``control_cost`` buys a gentler one. (LQR's ``R``; the agent's effort
            penalty.)
        tol: Absolute tolerance on successive cost-to-go iterates; convergence is
            declared when they stop moving by more than this.
        max_iter: Iteration cap before the Riccati recursion is declared to have
            failed to converge.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the model has no ``control`` matrix, or a cost matrix does
            not match the state/action dimensions, is not symmetric, or fails its
            definiteness requirement (``state_cost`` PSD, ``control_cost`` PD).
        RuntimeError: If the control Riccati does not converge within ``max_iter``
            — typically because ``(dynamics, control)`` is not stabilisable.
